    \class QMqttClient

    \inmodule QtMqtt
    \brief The QMqttClient class represents the central access communicating
    with an MQTT broker.

    An MQTT client is a program or device that uses MQTT to create a network
    connection to an MQTT server, also called a \e broker. The connection
    request must contain a unique client identifier. Optionally, it can contain
    a Will Topic, Will Message, user name, and password.

    Once a connection is created, a client can send messages that other clients
    might be interested in receiving, subscribe to request notifications on
    topics, unsubscribe to remove a request for notifications, and disconnect
    from the broker.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::clientId
    \brief This property holds the client's identifier value.

    Each client needs to have a unique ID to be able to connect to an MQTT
    broker. If no client ID is specified by the user, one will be generated
    automatically when a connection is established.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::hostname
    \brief This property holds the hostname of the MQTT broker to connect to.

    If no transport is specified via setTransport(), the client will instantiate
    a socket connection to the specified hostname itself.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::port
    \brief This property holds the port to connect to the MQTT broker.

    If no transport is specified via setTransport(), the client will instantiate
    a socket connection to a host with this port number.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::keepAlive
    \brief This property holds the interval at which regular ping messages are
    sent to the broker.

    Once a connection to a broker is established, the client needs to send
    frequent updates to propagate it can still be reached. The interval between
    those updates is specified by this property.

    The interval is specified in milliseconds. However, most brokers are not
    capable of using such a high granularity and will fall back to an interval
    specified in seconds.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::protocolVersion
    \brief This property holds the MQTT standard version to use for connections.

    Specifies the version of the standard the client uses for connecting to a
    broker. Valid values are:

    \list
        \li 3: MQTT standard version 3.1.
        \li 4: MQTT standard version 3.1.1, often referred to MQTT 4.
    \endlist
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::state
    \brief This property holds the current state of the client.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::error
    \brief Specifies the current error of the client.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::username
    \brief This property holds the user name for connecting to a broker.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::password
    \brief This property holds the password for connecting to a broker.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::cleanSession
    \brief This property holds the state after connecting to a broker.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::willTopic
    \brief This property holds the Will Topic.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::willMessage
    \brief This property holds the payload of a Will Message.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::willQoS
    \brief This property holds the level of QoS for sending and storing the
    Will Message.
*/

/*!
    \property QMqttClient::willRetain
    \brief This property holds whether the Will Message should be retained on
    the broker for future subscribers to receive.
*/

    \enum QMqttClient::TransportType

    This enum type specifies the connection method to be used to instantiate a

           The transport uses a class based on a QIODevice.
    \value AbstractSocket
           The transport uses a class based on a QAbstractSocket.
    \value SecureSocket
           The transport uses a class based on a QSslSocket.

    This enum type specifies the states a client can enter.

    \value Disconnected
           The client is disconnected from the broker.

           A connection request has been made, but the broker has not approved
           the connection yet.
    \value Connected
           The client is connected to the broker.

    \enum QMqttClient::ClientError

    This enum type specifies the error state of a client.

           No error occurred.
    \value InvalidProtocolVersion
           The broker does not accept a connection using the specified protocol
           version.
    \value IdRejected
           The client ID is malformed. This might be related to its length.
    \value ServerUnavailable
           The network connection has been established, but the service is
           unavailable on the broker side.
    \value BadUsernameOrPassword
           The data in the username or password is malformed.
    \value NotAuthorized
           The client is not authorized to connect.
    \value TransportInvalid
           The underlying transport caused an error. For example, the connection
           might have been interrupted unexpectedly.
    \value ProtocolViolation
           The client encountered a protocol violation, and therefore closed the
           connection.
    \value UnknownError
           An unknown error occurred.
