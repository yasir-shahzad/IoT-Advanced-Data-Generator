# IoT Advanced Data Generator

IoT Advanced Data Generator is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate IoT data generation and network traffic analysis on a single machine.

The tool caters to the need for IoT data for research and analysis. Most available IoT data generators are web-based or cloud-based, restricting functionality extension as their codes are not publicly available. IoT Advanced Data Generator resolves this limitation by providing an open-source platform allowing for the addition of new protocols and functionalities.

## Key Features

- **Compromised IoT Device**: Introduces the concept of a compromised IoT device, a unique feature absent in existing IoT data generators.
- **Use Case Creation**: Users can create use cases and add devices with distinct IPs, providing a flexible environment for scenario building.
- **Network Traffic Logging**: Allows complete network traffic monitoring using Wireshark on the same machine.
